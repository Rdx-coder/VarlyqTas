## Introduction

This project is a RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides various routes for managing posts and users. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication is used to secure the API, and Redis is used for caching.

## Features

- User registration and authentication using JWT tokens.
- Create, read, update, and delete posts.
- Get a list of users and posts with user details.
- Redis-based caching for improved performance.
- Secure password storage with hashing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB installed and running.
- Redis server installed and running.
- Git (optional but recommended for version control).

## Getting Started

 Clone the repository:

 bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-api-project.git
   cd your-api-project

## Install dependencies:
npm install
Create a .env file and configure your environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection, JWT secret, Redis host, etc.).

## Start the server:
npm start
Your API should now be running on http://localhost:3000 
## API Routes
/users

GET /users: Get a list of users.
POST /users: Register a new user.
DELETE /users/:userId: Delete a user.
PUT /users/:userId: Update a user.
/posts

GET /posts: Get a list of posts with user details.
POST /posts: Create a new post.
DELETE /posts/:postId: Delete a post.
PUT /posts/:postId: Update a post.
For detailed usage of each route, refer to the API documentation.

## Authentication
Authentication is done using JWT tokens. To access protected routes, include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.

## Configuration
You can configure the API by editing the .env file. Customize it according to your needs.

## Deployment
To deploy this API to a production environment, follow these steps:

Set up a production-ready database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
Update the .env file with production configurations.
Use a process manager like PM2 to run the Node.js server.
Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for handling incoming requests.
## Testing
To run tests, use the following command:
npm test
